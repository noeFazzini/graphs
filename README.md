# Common graphs algorithms

### Maximum bipartite matching

### Stable marriage
Given N men and N women, where each person has ranked all members of the opposite sex in order of preference, marry the men and women together such that there are no two people of opposite sex who would both rather have each other than their current partners. If there are no such people, all the marriages are “stable” 

### Bellman-Ford
Given a graph and a source vertex src in the graph, find the shortest paths from source to all vertices in the given graph. The graph may contain negative weight edges. 

### Dijkstra
Given a graph and a source vertex in the graph, find the shortest paths from the source to all vertices in the given graph
